# Datadog Lambda Layer Example

This is a (tiny!) example, using the [Datadog lambda layer](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-lambda-layer-python) for Python.

It uses [Chalice](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-lambda-layer-python), a Flask like framework built for Serverless apps.

It's cool because you can do things like respond to SNS notifications or schedule things to run at a certain time in code.

Right now the app doesn't do much, other than get instrumented. That might change soon!
